## Project Overview

We are developing a self-driving autonomous car using advanced artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms, including neural network graphs and genetic algorithms. This project aims to simulate and implement autonomous driving capabilities in various stages and integrate both software and hardware components.

## Simulations

### Stage 1: Hardcoded JavaScript Simulation

- Implemented using FeedForward neural networks.
- Focuses on basic autonomous driving tasks.

### Stage 2: Unity C# for 2D Simulation

- Utilizes Unity game engine for more realistic 2D simulations.
- Enhances simulation complexity and visual fidelity.

### Stage 3: Carla for 3D Simulation

- Uses Carla simulator with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing.
- Mimics real-life scenarios with capabilities such as pedestrian detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition.
- Provides a platform for testing complex driving scenarios.

## Hardware Prototype

We have also developed a hardware prototype using Arduino C, servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and Bluetooth module (HC-05). The prototype features:

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Autonomous navigation around obstacles.
- **Bluetooth Control**: Manual control for testing and development purposes.
